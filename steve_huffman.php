With their business				plan in mind, the pair travelled to Cambridge, MA during their senior				year spring break to hear Paul Graham give a talk titled "How to				Start a Startup." After the lecture, Alexis invited Graham out for a				drink so he and Steve could pitch Graham on their business idea. 				Graham agreed, loved the idea, and a suggested they apply to a new				seed stage venture firm he'd launched called Y Combinator.</p>											<figure class="figcontainer">						<img src="images/steve_huffman.jpg" alt="current picture">						<figcaption>Fig1. Steve Huffman Co-founder of Reddit and Hipmunk.</figcaption> 				</figure> 				<p>Alexis and Steve's original plan was to build an infrastructure				that would allow people to order food from their cell phones. 				Though the idea was rejected, Alexis and Steve were invited to join				the first class of Y Combinator, on the condition that they'd come				up with a new concept. The next idea they pitched to Graham would				become reddit.com.</p>								<figure class="figcontainer">					<img src="images/college.jpg" alt="college picture">					<figcaption>Fig2. Steve Huffman (left) and Alexis Ohanian (right), college classmates and co-founders of Reddit.</figcaption> 				</figure>								<p>Sixteen months after leaving the University of Virginia, they				founded reddit in June 2005. Reddit was initially funded by Y 				Combinator. Reddit was later acquired by Conde Nast in 2006.</p> 										<h2>Reddit-"The Front Page of the Internet"</h2>							<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is an online social media community where				users vote on content. It is coded in Python. There are sub-communities, or subreddits,				that any user may create that are independent and moderated by a				team of volunteers. Some subreddits cater to a more technical				audience- such as r/sysadmin and r/vmware subreddits. Reddit users				submit links to online content and vote on which stories and 				discussions are important. Anyone can join Reddit. Anyone can				participate.</p>							<p>The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and 50				such categories, or "default subreddits," are visible on the front				page to new users and those who browse the site without logging in				to an account. As of May 2014, these include:</p>							<table border="1">										<tr>						<td><strong>Category</strong></td>						<td><strong>Subreddits</strong></td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Educational</td>									<td>News, Science, Space, TodayILearned (TIL), 						and WorldNews</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Entertainment</td>						<td>Creepy, Documentaries, Gaming, ListenToThis,						Movies, Music, NoSleep, Sports, Television,						and Videos</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Discussion-Based</td>						<td>AskReddit, AskScience, Books, ExplainLikeImFive, 						IAmA, and TwoXChromosomes</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Humor/ Light-Hearted</td>						<td>DataIsBeautiful, Funny, InternetIsBeautiful, Jokes,						NotTheOnion, ShowerThoughts, StandUpShots, TIFU,						and UpliftingNews</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Image Sharing</td>						<td>Art, Aww, EarthPorn, Gifs, MildlyInteresting,						OldSchoolCool, Pics, and PhotoshopBattles</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Self-Improvement</td>						<td>DIY, Fitness, Food, GetMotivated, LifeProTips, 						PersonalFinance, Philosophy, and WritingPrompts</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Technology</td>						<td>Futurology and Gadgets</td>					</tr>										<tr>						<td>Meta</td>						<td>Announcements and Blog</td>					</tr>								</table>																	<p>When items (links or text posts) are submitted to a subreddit, 				users (redditors) can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote)				Each subreddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that 				have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the				submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation-tree of				comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted.				The front page of the site itself shows a combination of the highest				-rated posts out of all the subreddits a user is subscribed to.</p>							<h2>Reddit's Timeline</h2>							<ol>					<li>In June 2005, Reddit was founded in Medford,					Massachusetts by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian,					both 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. </li>					<li>The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in 					November 2005. Between November 2005 and January 2006 Reddit					merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, and Swartz became					an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug.					Conde Nast Publications, owner of Wired, acquired Reddit on					October 31, 2006, and the team moved to San Francisco. In 					January 2007, Swartz was fired. </li>					<li>By the end of 2008, the team had grown to include					Erik Martin, Jeremy Edberg, David King, and Mike Schiraldi. 					In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian moved on to form Hipmunk,					recruiting Slowe and King shortly thereafter.</li>					<li>On September 6, 2011, Reddit became operationally					independent of Conde Nast, now operating as a separate					subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications</li>					<li>On March 23, 2013, Reddit powered 4,206 active communities					consisting of more than 2,094,953 logged in redditors casting 					over 16,121,282 votes. It's a growing platform with an engaged 					technical audience. As of November 2014, there were 174 million					users on Reddit.</li>				</ol>								<h2>Steve Huffman Post Reddit</h2>							<p>Huffman's other claim to fame is being a co-founder of 				consumer-orientated online travel company Hipmunk.<p>							<p>Hipmunk was launched in August 2010 after Steve Huffman and				Adam Goldstein worked together for nearly three months during Y				Combinator's Summer 2010 class. Alexis Ohanian joined the team				days before the launch.[11] Hipmunk relied on Orbitz to get its				flight data at first, but in November 2010 the company signed a 				deal to use ITA Software's QPX Solution. As of 2011 all major US 				travel search engines, such as Kayak, FareCompare, Bing, and 				TripAdvisor, are powered by ITA.</p>							<p>Hipmunk presents search results chronologically by time of day				on a single page. Flights are ranked by price, schedule, and				"agony", a score based on factors such as duration of the flight and				number of stops. The search engine also ranks hotels, filtered by				price, reviews, and an "ecstasy" rating. Aside from flights and 				hotels, the service looks up airbnb results and sorts relevant train				routes provided by Amtrak. Hipmunk is programmed using Python and 				Tornado and rents infrastructure from Amazon EC2. </p>							<p>The company makes money by collecting commissions for directing				flight and hotel purchase traffic to airlines, hotels, and other				travel-search sites. For example Orbitz pays Hipmunk its standard 				rate of $3 per flight sold.  In February 2011, Hipmunk introduced 				an iPhone app, followed by an iPad-dedicated app four months later.				In August 2011, Hipmunk passed one million search queries per month.				Time magazine included Hipmunk in its list of "The 50 Best Websites				of 2011".</p>			</article>			<div class="safety">				<h2>An important message about internet safety:</h2>				<img src="images/safety5.jpg" alt="INTERNET SAFETY">			</div>		</div>		<footer>			<h2>Citations</h2>			<ul class="citations">				<li><a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/what-reddit-and-why-should-you-care">What is Reddit and why should you care? from Symantec Connect</a>,				Christy Loerzel, 2013.</li>				<li><a href="http://alexisohanian.com/pages/about">Alexis Ohanian Bio</a>,				Alexis Ohanian, 2013.</li>				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman">Steve Huffman Wikipedia Page</a>,				Wikipedia, 2015.</li>				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">Reddit Wikipedia Page</a>,				Wikipedia, 2015.</li>				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipmunk">Hipmunk Wikipedia Page</a>,				Wikipedia, 2015.</li>			</ul>						<p>This webpage, by Rachel S.
