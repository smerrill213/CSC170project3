		<h1>Sister Mary Kenneth Keller</h1>

		<article>

			<p>
				Mary Kenneth Keller was born in December 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio. Keller entered the Sisters of Charity, a Catholic religious order, in 1932, and professed her vows in 1940. She also wrote four books on the topic of computer science. </p>

				<p> Keller felt that women should be involved in computer science and especially in the field of information specialist. In her words, "We're having an information explosion, among others, and it's certainly obvious that information is of no use unless it's available." Keller's vision extended beyond education and reached toward artificial intelligence. "For the first time, we can now mechanically simulate the cognitive process. We can make studies in artificial intelligence. Beyond that, this mechanism [the computer] can be used to assist humans in learning. As we are going to have more mature students in greater numbers as time goes on, this type of teaching will probably be increasingly important." Sister Mary Keller died in 1985 at the age of 71, and has left a significant legacy in the field of computer science and computer science education. 
				Unfortunately, there is not much information on Keller's life before she received her graduate degrees, with even her borth year being debated.

			<h2>Education</h2>

				<p>

					Sister Mary Kenneth Keller studied at DePaul University, where she received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and M.S. degrees in Mathematics and Physics. As a graduate student, she studied at Dartmouth, Purdue and the University of Michigan. She was one of the first to make Dartmouth break its "men only rule," allowing her to work in the computer center where she contributed to the development of BASIC. 
					In 1965, at the age of 51, Keller received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin. She is the first American woman to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Her dissertation work, titled <em>Inductive Inference on a Computer Generated Patterns,</em> involved constructing algorithms that performed analytic differentiation on algebraic expression, written in CDC FORTRAN 63.

			<h2>Major Accomplishments</h2>

				<h3>BASIC</h3>

					<p>
					<strong>BASIC</strong> stands for <strong>Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code,</strong> and is a famly of general-purpose, high-level programming languages. The purpose of BASIC was to help bridge the gap between only scientists and mathematicians being able to write and use custom software on their computers. It made computers accessible and easy for everyday use. 
					Keller worked with a group of other Dartmouth students udner the supervision of John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz. The original BASIC language was designed on May 1, 1964.

				<h3>Clarke College</h3>

					<p>
						After receiving her Ph.D., Keller accepted an offer of a faculty position at Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa. Keller founded the Computer Science Department there and chaired it for 20 years. She also established a master's degree program for computer applications in education. Clarke College now has the Keller Computer Center and Information Services, named after her, which provides computing and telecommunication support to Clarke College members. The college has also established the Mary Kenneth Keller Computer Science Scholarship in her honor.

			<h2>The Significance of BASIC</h2>

				<p>
					The introduction of the first microcomputers in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite Dijkstra's famous 1975 judgement "It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.", BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training, and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers. </p>
					<p>
					One of the first BASICs to appear was Tiny BASIC, a simple BASIC variant designed by Dennis Allison at the urging of Bob Albrecht of theHomebrew Computer Club. He had seen BASIC on minicomputers and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines like the MITS Altair 8800. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an interpreter for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the People's Computer Company newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte. Versions were written by Li-Chen Wang and Tom Pittman.</p>

					<p>
					In 1975 MITS released Altair BASIC, developed by Bill Gates and Paul Allen as the company Micro-Soft,which eventually grew into corporate giant Microsoft. The first Altair version was co-written by Gates, Allen, and Monte Davidoff. </p>
					<p>

					Almost universally, home computers of the 1980s had a ROM-resident BASIC interpreter, which the machines booted directly into.When the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977, all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in immediate mode was presented, not the command line interface used on systems running CP/M or MS-DOS. Commodore Business Machines included a version of Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The Atari 8-bit family had their own Atari BASIC that was modified in order to fit on an 8 kB ROM cartridge. The BBC published BBC BASIC, developed for them by Acorn Computers Ltd, incorporating many extrastructured programming keywords and advanced floating-point operation features. </p>
					<p>
					As the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, magazines (such as Creative Computing in the U.S.) published complete source code in BASIC for games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to type in the code from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from Creative Computing as "BASIC Computer Games". This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform.The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the home computer market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as Learn to Program BASIC would also have gaming as an introductory focus. </p>
					<p>
					On the business-focused CP/M computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, Microsoft BASIC (MBASIC) was one of the leading applications.</p>

					<h3>BASIC Syntax</h3>

					<p>BASIC's intuitive syntax shows how easy to use it is, making it accessible to the average person.</p>
